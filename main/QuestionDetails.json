   "body": "<p>Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>&quot;Use a transaction!&quot;</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the <a href=\"https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-routes-and-schedules/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto</a></li>\n<li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li>\n<li>The code is compiled with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Visual C++</a> 2005 as &quot;Release&quot; with &quot;Full Optimization&quot; (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li>\n<li>I'm using the SQLite &quot;Amalgamation&quot;, compiled directly into my test application.

We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The &quot;Worst-Case-Scenario&quot;</h2>\n<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>\n<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')&quot;, sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);\nsqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    ...\n\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>\n<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */\ncStartClock = clock();\n\nsprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)&quot;);\nsqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;);   /* Get Route */\n    sBR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Branch */\n    sVR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Version */\n    sST = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Stop Number */\n    sVI = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Vehicle */\n    sDT = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Date */\n    sTM = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);\n\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\nprintf(&quot;Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\\n&quot;, n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);\n\nsqlite3_finalize(stmt);\nsqlite3_close(db);\n\nreturn 0;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>\n<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>\n<pre><code>#define DATABASE &quot;:memory:&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>\n<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>\n<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>\n<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>\n<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>\n<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n...\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>\n"

I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();\ntrace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));\n// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n// Ah, young love!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the \"Empty Trash\" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.</p>\n\n<p>Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.</p>\n\n<p>I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base.

Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting <code>header</code> inside <code>content</code> will not allow this to work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>\n"

This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of \"this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 1</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 2</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>\n\n<p>If we look in the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 3</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [\"value\"]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [0]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n    [\"key\"]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>\n\n<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's find out what that \"unexpected behavior\" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 4</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 5</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the \"copy of source\" theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that <code>foreach</code> works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is this correct and the whole story?</li>\n<li>If not, what is it really doing?</li>\n<li>Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (<code>each()</code>, <code>reset()</code> et al.) during a <code>foreach</code> could affect the outcome of the loop?</li>\n</ul>\n"

   "body": "<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>\n<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li>\n<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>\n<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>\n<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>\n<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. \"on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp\").</li>\n<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> &amp; <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li>\n<li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?</em> </li>\n<li><em>When would you use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins?</em></li>\n<li><em>Please provide examples when you need to use a combination</em></li>\n</ol>\n"

After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of <code>2048</code>.</p>\n\n<p>One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal.
